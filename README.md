## Description

This project is a little file hosting/sharing platform, made as both a passion project and as an easy way to share and host files for me and my friends.
It's insecure and definitely subject to a lot of change, but this is my first actual project :).

## Table of Contents

- [File structure](#Filestructure)
- [Todo](#Todo)

## File structure

There are three webpages, four script files, and one style document.
The three pages share the js file, and the php files are used by the backend to handle file storage, lookup, and deletion on the server. The file explorer uses js to dynamically draw the table of items stored on the server. 
Missing are a htaccess file and the files folder, as those are irrelevant in the github project.

## Todo

Dark mode
Make the file explorer support directories.
